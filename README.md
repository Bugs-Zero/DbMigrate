# DbMigrate

Sample code showing some techniques for writing low-bug software, including:

- Ports-and-adapters with contract tests keeping the adapters in synch.

- Test-as-spec, with test names written with the Ubiqutious Language.

- Whole Value

Oh, and it also can be used to run migrations against a database. Currently supports Sql Server and SQLite.

Migrations are awesome and support incremental database refactoring. Check out Refactoring Databases, by Ambler and Saldage, to see how this makes state oh so easy - without having to go all unstructured.
